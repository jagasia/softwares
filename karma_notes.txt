1) lets create an angular project
	ng new suramya --routing --style=css

2) What is karma jasmine?
	Jasmine is the testing framework for testing angular projects
	Karma is the test runner

3) When we use karma, then we will have a karma configuration file in our angular project

WHenever we create an angular project, by default a file is being created
	karma.conf.js

this is the configuration file for configuring testing
	i) we specify the framework (jasmine) we choose.
	ii) browser	(chrome)
	

Lets open our project in VS Code

	
first, REMEMBER, copy the karma.conf.js (OR ITS CONTENT safely before we experiment)

-------------
1) lets run a command in cmd prompt to create this conf file
	karma init

	** if you get error that karma is not recognized command, then we need to install it using below command
		npm install -g karma-cli



framework:
	jasmine

autowatch:
	true			means, whenever, we modify our spec.ts, automatically our test runner will be notified and updated



so far, we have not started testing
	to start testing
		command is 
			ng test	





describe		there can be lot of describe
fdescribe		f - first			this describe must be executed first.	(only one)
xdescribe		x - exclude			ignore some describes for time being.
